# Prepared update — unreleased

The combined development source prepares the next update without a version
bump, tag or GitHub release. The latest published download remains **v1.6**.
The registry-derived [supported inventory](SUPPORTED_GAMES.md) reflects source
support. A Windows preview build is provided as a workflow artifact after the
combined checks; it does not replace the published release.

Each has its own parser and explicit identity/revision gates. Resource ceilings
without natural-cap proof are manual editing limits and are excluded from Max.
Unknown items, unrelated regions, empty records, acquisitions and dependent
story/level/reward transitions are preserved.

## Expanded existing editors

| Editor | Addition |
| --- | --- |
| DW4 Hyper and DW4 Xtreme Legends PS2 | Already-owned harness/orb assignment with item-ownership protection; Hyper additionally supports guarded existing created-officer cosmetics and consistent paired progression mirrors. Independent genuine exports now qualify both profiles. |
| Warriors All-Stars PC | Select already-owned ordinary Hero Cards from the same hero pool; searchable occupied card records, preserving special gifts and card properties. |
| DW7 XL Definitive PC | Named first/second existing equipped-weapon choices reference only valid owned inventory slots. |
| DW6 PC | Named element choices for existing qualified weapons: Fire, Ice, Lightning or none. |
| Warriors Orochi Z | Existing own-pool equipped weapon selection and coherent progressed EXP confined to the already opened level. |
| Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate Definitive PC | Additional qualified ranked weapon attributes and guarded attack-reinforcement reductions; binary/dormant effects remain preserved. |
| Hyrule Warriors Definitive Edition Switch | Existing generic weapon stars and ordinary positive seal KO reductions; special weapons and collection-dependent seals stay protected. |
| Samurai Warriors 4 PS3 | Searchable native weapon and attached-skill records, separate from proficiency EXP/level inspection. |
| Dynasty Warriors: Origins | Searchable existing weapon slots, upgrades and six stored trait IDs/levels; reserved records preserved. |

Other implemented games were reviewed for additional save-backed systems; the
per-game notes record specific dependency or input blockers. DW3 Remastered's
existing rich editor is retained. No runtime trainer address or another
platform's mapping is presented as a native save field.

## Interface and maintenance

- Search games by name, short name, platform or feature; filter by series and
  platform, including All platforms. Ctrl+F focuses global library search and
  Enter opens a single result.
- Compact cards, result counts, clear filters and visible resume-session buttons.
- Named choice controls and bounded backend-validated text fields; multi-field
  staging stays atomic and preserves Undo and Review Changes.
- Sort field, inspector and review tables by clicking columns; copy selected
  inspector rows with headings. Large integers retain exact sorting precision.
- Keep per-game modules under `src/koei_editor/games`, common utilities under
  `shared`, unregistered research under `research`, and notes under `docs`.
- Keep supported games synchronized in the registry, code index, runtime
  catalog, README and generated document. AGENTS/CONTRIBUTING require this.
- Guard the additional official live save directories and preserve source-copy,
  backup, new-destination and restore protections.

## Research and validation

The [regional-edition follow-up](REGIONAL_EDITION_SCOPE.md) distinguishes
publisher-verified products from proved save compatibility. DW5 Special keeps
its existing Windows equipment adapter with explicit regional evidence limits.
DW6 Special PS2/PSP, DW7 Special PSP, Orochi 3 Special PSP and SW3 Z Special PSP
remain research-only. A bounded unregistered PSP envelope inspector checks
selected product metadata and secure declarations; it cannot authenticate,
decrypt, edit or encrypt gameplay. See [PSP responsibilities](PSP_SPECIAL_RESEARCH.md),
[DW6 product distinctions](DW6_SPECIAL_REGIONAL_RESEARCH.md) and
[DW7 qualification](DW7_SPECIAL_PSP_RESEARCH.md). No native Windows DW6 Special
product/profile or cross-region conversion is claimed.

The original PC profiles above have independent period disk-reader/writer
evidence and two independently shared genuine files each. SW2 HD PS3, console
containers, Orochi Z and later Orochi games are separate profiles. The
[SW2](SW2_PC_FORMAT.md) and [Orochi](WO1_PC_FORMAT.md) notes record native
integrity, serialization, per-mechanic blockers and validation distinctions.

The three newly supplied files identify Orochi Z, WO3 Ultimate Definitive PC
and SW4 DX respectively; the file described as DW7 is an Orochi Z file.
[The supplier table](REMAINING_INPUTS.md) lists exact remaining inputs.
[Additional research](ADDITIONAL_EDITOR_SURVEY.md) and game notes distinguish
real save editors, asset tools, runtime trainers and unsupported platform leads.
The [Team Ninja coverage](TEAM_NINJA_RESEARCH.md) records native integrity and
mechanic blockers for Nioh 1/2, Stranger of Paradise, Sigma/Sigma 2 and Black.
Each edition/platform stays separate; active integrity flags are retained.

The separate hunting/monster-development investigation acquired public PC save
archives for [Toukiden Kiwami](TOUKIDEN_KIWAMI_RESEARCH.md) and
[Toukiden 2](TOUKIDEN2_RESEARCH.md), but neither native codec/integrity nor
writable mappings qualified. [Monster Rancher 1 & 2 DX](MONSTER_RANCHER_DX_RESEARCH.md)
also remains blocked on complete native Windows files and serialization proof.
These four titles add no library card or runtime support claim; each note records
mechanic dependencies, source/licence boundaries and exact next inputs.

Native shared player exports qualify unchanged roundtrips, targeted byte edits,
checksums where present, malformed inputs, GUI workflows and backups. Procedural
fixtures cover independent adversarial cases. No attached executable was run;
no edited save was loaded/re-saved in a game. Native Windows build checks and
full regression totals are recorded after integration. No player files,
account identifiers, attached binaries or personal paths are included in Git.

The Berserk/AoT follow-up adds reproducible **read-only outer-envelope research**
and detailed mechanic/input checklists. All three genuine Windows contributor
copies pass unchanged cipher/checksum diagnostics; their gameplay records,
revision gates and remaining integrity are still unqualified. They add no game
cards or writable features. [Evidence and tests](OTHER_KOEI_PC_RESEARCH.md).
