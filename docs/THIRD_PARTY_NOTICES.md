# Bundled runtime notices

The Windows executable includes Python, the Tcl/Tk runtime, and the PyInstaller bootloader. Their supplied license texts are retained in the `licenses` folder. PyInstaller's bootloader has an exception for distributed bundled applications; see its full notice.

The editor uses Windows CNG from the operating system; no separate crypto library is redistributed. Original editor code is covered by the MIT `LICENSE` file.

Non-Windows source development can optionally use the installed cryptography
package as an AES test provider. It is not bundled by the Windows build, which
continues to use native CNG. Origins reference metadata cites public resources;
no downloaded save or third-party research code is redistributed.

PC format research references the DW8 XL converter by koko-tsuu, the public
Pirate Warriors 3 PC save by Ceraph1216, and the Apollo save/patch databases and
PS3 save decrypters maintained by `bucanero`. These are research
references, not bundled dependencies. Their implementations, saves, game assets,
console keys and account data are not redistributed. The new cipher and editor
code was independently written from factual format observations. See
`KOEI_FORMATS.md` for inspected commits, sample fingerprints and limits.

The Gundam and Ken's Rage PS3 adapters independently implement factual patch
positions, native integrity and observed layout rules. Apollo GPL patch/library
source and external player samples are research references only; no implementation,
catalog, save, console/account metadata or game asset is redistributed. See
[licensed Musou evidence](LICENSED_MUSOU.md).

Additional mechanics research references `gamesaves/OPPW3`, published native PC
instruction/structure annotations from `Hexorg/CheatEngineTables`, PC runtime
research by `Glubus/oppw4-sdk` and `Glubus/oppw4-data`, and tutorial translation
semantics from `ayozetr/berserk-band-of-the-hawk-es`. Those sources are not bundled;
no trainer/script is executed or redistributed. See `GAME_MECHANICS.md` for
evidence classes, exact commits, authored summaries and unresolved dependencies.

The DW4 Hyper candidate, DW8 Empires research codec and Persona 5 Strikers stream
primitive are independently authored from published format facts. Source URLs
and inspected commits are recorded in PC_RESEARCH_RETRY.md. No implementation
from the supplied DW4 repositories or P5S utility, downloaded executables,
screenshots or external guide prose is bundled. Officer/item names and numerical
layout observations are factual labels; candidate status remains explicit.

The Atelier Sophie 2 codec is adapted from
[Tartarshia/Sophie2SaveEditor](https://github.com/Tartarshia/Sophie2SaveEditor/tree/93d807072a852c73799394af4d32fb164841cd3e),
copyright 2026 Sophie2SaveEditor contributors, under MIT. The complete notice
is retained in `licenses/atelier-sophie2-save-editor-MIT.txt` and embedded in the
standalone EXE. Changes add bounded parsing and preserve opaque footer and
decoded trailing-zero data. Its GUI and player saves are not bundled.

`src/koei_editor/research/katana/katana_codec.py` adapts algorithms from
[mi5hmash/KatanaSaveDataResigner](https://github.com/mi5hmash/KatanaSaveDataResigner/tree/4c90a2b388438cb27a9752e6eab7333257de215f),
copyright 2026 Michał Gębicki, MIT. See
`licenses/katana-save-data-resigner-MIT.txt`. Native encrypted/decrypted pairs
stay outside public packages. The registered Fatal Frame II Remake adapter reuses
these attributed cipher/checksum primitives and embeds the exact MIT notice.
Its gameplay schema and surgical writer are independently authored; upstream
dummy files are not native evidence. Nioh and SOP gameplay writes are disabled here;
no native checksum-bypass behavior is copied into the application.

Source-only Nioh 2 inspection references the published Apache-2.0 scalar map in
[alfizari/Nioh-2-Save-Editor](https://github.com/alfizari/Nioh-2-Save-Editor/tree/7de1e3d5b20b7f94b055eb228a5e3b0746ea1452).
The attribution, modification notice and licence are retained in
`licenses/nioh2-save-editor-Apache-2.0.txt`. This implementation exposes no
editable Nioh 2 fields and does not redistribute its native utility or save.


The v1.5 DW7 XL, DW8 Empires, WO3 Ultimate, Orochi Z, Samurai Warriors 4 DX,
Pirate Warriors 4, All-Stars, Abyss and Nioh 3 implementations are independently
written from statically recovered and published format facts. Evidence and
pinned-source references appear in their linked game checklists in
EXPANSION_COVERAGE.md. Existing MIT-attributed Koei/Katana primitives are reused
where noted. No GPL, noncommercial or no-derivatives implementation, external
editor, game executable, extracted game data or player save is incorporated.
New Sophie 2 refill/presentation logic follows the published MIT ItemRecord;
its existing full MIT notice remains included.

The additional SW4-II PC adapter and Sanada read-only framing investigation are
independently written using the existing project cipher primitive and facts
checked against genuine copies. Public memory research, checksum arithmetic,
manuals and save-editor discussions informed the investigations; no Van editor,
trainer implementation, restricted catalog, player file or downloaded binary is
included. Sources and the independent SW4-II qualification proof are documented
in [SW4II_FORMAT.md](SW4II_FORMAT.md) and [SANADA_PC_RESEARCH.md](SANADA_PC_RESEARCH.md).
The original DW9, DW8 edition-scope and optional Bladestorm notes likewise
introduce factual documentation, not external project implementations.

The Ryza 2 adapter reuses the existing attributed Sophie 2 envelope codec after
independent native checksum qualification. Its title-specific records and quality
writer are independently authored. Original Sophie and the read-only Arland
inspectors derive format facts from public references and genuine native copies;
no external editor implementation, restricted catalog or player data is bundled.
