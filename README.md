# Universal Koei Tecmo Save Editor

A free Windows save editor by **Mexican**, with a game library, shared Light/Dark
themes, searchable records, backups, Undo and Review Changes. Switch between
games while keeping each editing session open.

**Development source:** additions below are available in source. The latest
Windows download remains v1.6 until the next release.

## Supported games

Select the game and platform that match your save. Windows PC is selected by
default. Console editors open extracted or decrypted save exports: `.psu` for
PlayStation 2, `APP.BIN` for Wii U and DW7 PS3, `DATA.BIN` for SW4 PS3, and `svdt`
for Age of Calamity. Some PS3 profiles require the original `PARAM.SFO` beside
the copied gameplay file and edited output. Export and reimport/resign PS3 saves
with Apollo Save Tool; this editor does not rebuild `PARAM.PFD` or sign exports.

Ninja Gaiden II opens extracted Xbox 360/Xenia story `.dat` copies; CON/STFS
packages require a separate extraction and reintegration workflow. Sigma 2 and
Ninja Gaiden 2 Black use different formats.
