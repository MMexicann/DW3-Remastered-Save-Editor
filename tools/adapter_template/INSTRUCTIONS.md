# Scalar adapter starter

This scaffold stays unregistered and rejects every file until its native format
and storage encoding are implemented. It supplies no game offsets or support
claim. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and the
[root agent guide](../../AGENTS.md).

1. Create `src/koei_editor/games/<game>/` with `__init__.py`. Copy and rename the
   parser/editor scaffolds into that package; use qualified package imports.
   Choose a stable game/platform ID. Do not copy files into the repository root.
2. Qualify title/revision, size, structure, integrity, codec/container metadata
   and occupied records. Implement the codec seams and a frozen field type
   satisfying `koei_editor.shared.adapter_contract.ScalarField`, with evidenced
   bounds and storage encoding. `maxable=False` must exclude dependency-sensitive
   choices and unproved natural caps from bulk actions.
3. Register the implemented game in `koei_editor.game_registry.GAMES` with
   qualified editor/parser/backend module paths, extension, platform and honest
   provenance. Update reviewed runtime metadata, the supported-game inventory,
   README/document and tests together. Research without an editor remains in
   `src/koei_editor/research/<game>/`, outside the gameplay library.
4. Optional `record_label`, `field_hint` and `inspection_rows` backend hooks
   customize inspection. Richer views subclass `ScalarPresentation` and set the
   editor's `presentation_type`. Add no game-ID branches to shared GUI/CLI code.
5. Copy `contract_test.py` into `tests/test_<game>_contract.py` and supply
   `fixture_bytes()`. Test no-op/stage/unstage, targeted payload edits, rejection,
   immutable input, backups/restore, new destinations and changed-source safety.
   Add format corruption, identity, array/revision variation and dependency
   checks. Synthetic success is separate from native-file/in-game evidence.
6. Install and run focused tests, integration/GUI checks and the smoke test.
   Regenerate supported inventories with `python -m tools.update_supported_games`
   and verify `--check`. Coordinate qualified build imports/data and reviewed
   source-manifest additions. Add a format/evidence document to the docs index.

```text
python -m pip install -e .
python -m unittest tests.test_<game>_contract -v
python -m koei_editor --smoke-test
```

The copied-save CLI is `python -m koei_editor --game YOUR_ID --self-test INPUT
EMPTY_OUTPUT_DIR`. It preserves the input and creates private reports and
edited/restored copies. Reports and player fixtures never belong in public
source archives.
